I have spent the last 20 years or so in software development and, following this Mooc, I realized I hadnâ€™t really grasped the essence of object oriented design._ - Anonymous# Objectives- Revisit basic elements such as encapsulation, delegation- Think about essential aspects of object-oriented design- Learn key Design Patterns- Analyze real case studies- Things about Pharo code idioms# 10 modules![](figures/MapL.pdf width=80)% ${slide:title=10 modules}$% ${columns}$% ${column:width=50}$% - Understanding messages% - Tests and test driven % - Hooks% - Elementary design patterns% - Object Creation% - Double Dispatch% ${column:width=50}$% - Objects: state and behavior% - Object creation% - Registration% - Sharing objects% - Types% ${endColumns}$# Code examples from Pharo![](figures/Pharo.jpg width=65)Courtesy Pavel Krivanek% All the code samples and examples are from Pharo (*http://www.pharo.org*)#  Why Pharo (http://www.pharo.org)?- Pharo is pure and powerful object-oriented language- With only objects, messages, and lambdas, Pharo helps us to focus on important ideas!- Complement the excellent Pharo mooc \([http://mooc.pharo.org](http://mooc.pharo.org)\)# Our definition of polymorphism_If it walks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck._We use the terms **polymorphic** or **polymorphism** in the sense of:- exposing the same API, - being substituable,- an object can be replaced by another one because both present the same API \(set of messages\),- polymorphic objects do not have to be subtypes# A unique mooc- More than 60 years of experience in OO design and practices- Concrete cases- Knowledge actionable in many languages
