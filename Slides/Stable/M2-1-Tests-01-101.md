# Goal of the lecture 
- How can you **trust** that a change did not destroy something? 
- What is **my confidence** in the system? 
- What is unit testing? 
- How do I write tests? 
 
# Test main points 
- When there is a change 
  - Tests verify that what worked before still works 
  - Tests are your **life insurance**: you get aware of a side effect and **regression** 
- Tests are enablers of future evolution 
- Tests reduce the **fear of change** 
- Per se tests do not prevent bugs to happen but they reduce **unnoticed** bugs or side effects 
 
# About automation 
A unit test that is not **automated does NOT EXIST!** 
- Seriously! 
- Repetition 
- No human intervention 
 
# Unit tests 
- Unit tests ensure that you get the specified behavior of a class 
- Normally _unit_ tests do test a single feature 
- A test: one scenario, one point! 
 
# Anatomy of a test 
A test: 
- Creates a **context** 
- Performs a **stimulus**: an action in the context 
- **Checks** the result with **assertions** 
 
# Example: Testing duplicate set insertion 
A test: 
- Creates a context: Create an empty set 
- Performs a stimulus: Add twice the same element 
- Checks the results: Check that the set contains only one element 
 
# Set testcase in Pharo 
 
``` 
TestCase subclass: #SetTest
    ... 
``` 
 
``` 
SetTest >> testAdd
    | empty |
    "Context"
    empty := Set new.

    "Stimulus"
    empty add: 5.
    empty add: 5.

    "Check"
    self assert: empty size equals: 1.

SetTest run: #testAdd 
``` 
 
# Set testcase in Java (Junit40) 
 
``` 
import java.util.Set;
import java.util.HashSet;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

class SetTest {
    @Test
    public void testAdd() {
        Set empty = new HashSet();    // context

        empty.add(5);                               //Stimulus
        empty.add(5);

        assertEquals(empty.size(),1); //Check
    }
} 
``` 
 
# Success, failures, and errors 
- Success: a test passes 
- A **failure** is a failed assertion, i.e., a verified property/assertion failed 
- An **error** is an **unexpected** condition, i.e., an unexpected runtime error 
 
# A failure 
If we get `empty size` returning 2 instead of 1. 
``` 
SetTest >> testAdd
    | empty |
    empty := Set new.

    empty add: 5.
    empty add: 5.

    self assert: empty size equals: 1. 
``` 
 
# An error 
Sending the message `foobar:` raises an exception. 
``` 
SetTest >> testAdd
    | empty |
    empty := Set new.
    empty foobar: 5.
    self assert: empty size equals: 1. 
``` 
 
# How to reuse setting test context? 
If a context is repeated among tests: 
- duplication is never a good idea 
- hampers future evolution 
The framework offers the `setUp` method to create a context before any test execution. 
#  setUp and tearDown messages 
Executed **systematically** before and after each test run 
- `setUp` allows us to specify and reuse the context 
- `tearDown` to clean after test execution 
![](figures/SetUpTearDown.pdf width=60) 
# Defining a setUp method 
- Turn `empty` in an instance variable 
- Just create a context, here `empty` is initialized to an empty set. 
 
``` 
SetTestCase >> setUp
    empty := Set new 
``` 
 `setUp` is executed for you before any test execution 
``` 
SetTestCase >> testAdd
    empty add: 5.
    empty add: 5.

    self assert: empty size equals: 1. 
``` 
 
# About writing tests 
- Remember: Tests represent your trust in the system 
- Build them incrementally 
  - Do not need to focus on everything 
  - When a new bug shows up, write a test 
- Even better, write them before the code 
  - Act as your first client, produce a better interface 
- Active documentation is always in sync 
- They have a cost: writing them, maintaining them. Make them worth 
- But pay off is Huge 
 
# But I can't cover everything! 
Sure! Nobody can but: 
- When someone discovers a defect in code, first write a test that demonstrates the defect. 
- Then debug until the test succeeds. 
_Whenever you are tempted to type something into a print statement or a debugger expression, write it as a test instead._ Martin Fowler 
# Testing style: TDD 
_The style here is to write a few lines of code, then a test that should run, or even better, to write a test that won't run, then write the code that will make it run._ — Test Infected, Beck & Gamma, 1998 
- Write unit tests that thoroughly test a single class 
- Write tests as you develop \(even before you implement your class!\) 
- Write tests for every new piece of functionality 
\(see next lecture\) 
# Good tests 
- Repeatable 
- Do not require human intervention 
- Are _self-described_ 
- Change less often than the system 
- Tell a story 
 
# Conclusion 
- Invest in tests 
- Use Xtreme TDD: write a test, execute, debug, and code in the debugger \(see following lecture\) 
- Tests are your best investment
