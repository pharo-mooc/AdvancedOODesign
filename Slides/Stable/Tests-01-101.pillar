${slide:title=Goal of the lecture|label=less}$

- How can you trust that the changes did not destroy something?
- What is my confidence in the system?
- How do I write tests?
- What is unit testing?


${slide:title=Unit Tests}$

- Unit tests ensure that you get the specified behavior of the public interface of a class
- Normally Unit tests test a single class


${slide:title=A Test}$

A test
- Create a context 
- Send a stimulus 
- Check the results


${slide:title=A Test}$

A test
- Create a context: Create an empty set
- Send a stimulus: Add twice the same element
- Check the results: Check that the set contains only one element


${slide:title=Set TestCase}$

[[[
TestCase subclass: # SetTest
    ...
]]]

[[[
SetTest >> testAdd 
  | empty |
  empty := Set new.                      "Context"
  empty add: 5.                             "Stimulus"
  empty add: 5. 
  self assert: empty size = 1.        "Check"

SetTest run: #testAdd
]]]



${slide:title=About Writing Tests}$

- Remember: Tests represent your trust in the system
- Build them incrementally
-- Do not need to focus on everything
-- When a new bug shows up, write a test
- Even better write them before the code
-- Act as your first client, better interface
- Active documentation always in sync
- It has a cost, 
-- writing them, maintain them
- But pay off is Huge


${slide:title=Testing Style: TDD}$

"The style here is to write a few lines of code, then a test that should run, or even better, to write a test that won't run, then write the code that will make it run."

- Write unit tests that thoroughly test a single class
- Write tests as you develop (even before you implement)
- Write tests for every new piece of functionality

''Developers should spend 25-50\% of their time developing tests.''

${slide:title=But I can’t cover everything!}$

- Sure! Nobody can but
- When someone discovers a defect in code, first write a test that demonstrates the defect.
- Then debug until the test succeeds.

''Whenever you are tempted to type something into a print statement or a debugger expression, write it as a test instead.'' Martin Fowler


${slide:title=Good Tests}$

- Repeatable
- No human intervention
- "self-described"
- Change less often than the system
- Tells a story

${slide:title=Conclusion}$

- Invest in tests
- Use Xtreme TDD: write a test, execute, debug and code in the debugger
- Tests are your best investment
