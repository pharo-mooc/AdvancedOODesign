${slide:title=Goal of the lecture|label=less}$

- How can you ""trust"" that a change did not destroy something?
- What is ""my confidence"" in the system?
- What is unit testing?
- How do I write tests?



${slide:title=Test main points}$

- When there is a change
-- Tests verify that what worked before still works
-- Tests are your ""life insurance"": you get aware of a side effect and ""regression""
- Tests are enablers of future evolution
- Tests reduce the ""fear of change""
- Per se tests do not prevent bugs to happen but they reduce ""unnoticed"" bugs or side effects

${slide:title=About automation}$

A unit test that is not ""automated does NOT EXIST!""
- Seriously!
- Repetition
- No human intervention

${slide:title=Unit tests}$

- Unit tests ensure that you get the specified behavior of a class
- Normally ''unit'' tests do test a single feature
- A test: one scenario, one point!

${slide:title=Anatomy of a test}$

A test:
- Creates a ""context"" 
- Performs a ""stimulus"": an action in the context
- ""Checks"" the result with ""assertions""


${slide:title=Example: Testing duplicate set insertion}$

A test:
- Creates a context: Create an empty set
- Performs a stimulus: Add twice the same element
- Checks the results: Check that the set contains only one element


${slide:title=Set testcase in Pharo}$

[[[
TestCase subclass: #SetTest
    ...
]]]

[[[
SetTest >> testAdd 
    | empty |
    "Context"
    empty := Set new.

    "Stimulus"
    empty add: 5.
    empty add: 5. 

    "Check"
    self assert: empty size equals: 1.        

SetTest run: #testAdd
]]]

${slide:title=Set testcase in Java (Junit40)}$

[[[
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

class SetTest {

@Test
public void testAdd() {
    //Context 
	Set empty = new Counter();
    
    //Stimulus 
	empty.add(5);
	empty.add(5); 
    
    //Check
	assertEquals(empty.size(),1);
} }
]]]


${slide:title=Success, failures, and errors}$

- Success: a test passes
- A failure is a failed assertion, i.e., a verified property/assertion failed
- An error is an unexpected condition, i.e., an unexpected runtime error


${slide:title=A failure}$

If we get ==empty size== returning 2 instead of 1.

[[[
SetTest >> testAdd 
    | empty |
    empty := Set new.
    
    empty add: 5.
    empty add: 5.
    
    self assert: empty size equals: 1.
]]]

${slide:title=An error}$

Sending the message ==foobar:== raises an exception.

[[[
SetTest >> testAdd 
    | empty |
    empty := Set new.
    empty foobar: 5.
    self assert: empty size equals: 1.
]]]

${slide:How to reuse setting test context?}$

If a context is repeated among tests:
- duplication is never a good idea
- hampers future evolution

The framework offers the ==setUp== method to create a context before any test execution.

${slide: setUp and tearDown messages}$

Executed ""systematically"" before and after each test run
- ==setUp== allows us to specify and reuse the context
- ==tearDown== to clean after test execution

+>file://figures/SetUpTearDown.png|width=60+

${slide:title=Defining a setUp method}$

- Turn ==empty== in an instance variable
- Just create a context, here ==empty== is initialized to an empty set.

[[[
SetTestCase >> setUp
    empty := Set new
]]]

 ==setUp== is executed for you before any test execution

[[[
SetTestCase >> testAdd
    empty add: 5.
    empty add: 5.

    self assert: empty size equals: 1.
]]]



${slide:title=About writing tests}$

- Remember: Tests represent your trust in the system
- Build them incrementally
-- Do not need to focus on everything
-- When a new bug shows up, write a test
- Even better, write them before the code
-- Act as your first client, produce a better interface
- Active documentation is always in sync
- They have a cost: writing them, maintaining them. Make them worth
- But pay off is Huge


${slide:title=But I can't cover everything!}$

Sure! Nobody can but:
- When someone discovers a defect in code, first write a test that demonstrates the defect.
- Then debug until the test succeeds.

''Whenever you are tempted to type something into a print statement or a debugger expression, write it as a test instead.'' Martin Fowler

${slide:title=Testing style: TDD}$

"The style here is to write a few lines of code, then a test that should run, or even better, to write a test that won't run, then write the code that will make it run." — “Test Infected”, Beck & Gamma, 1998

- Write unit tests that thoroughly test a single class
- Write tests as you develop (even before you implement your class!)
- Write tests for every new piece of functionality

(see next lecture)

${slide:title=Good tests}$

- Repeatable
- Do not require human intervention
- Are ''self-described''
- Change less often than the system
- Tell a story

${slide:title=Conclusion}$

- Invest in tests
- Use Xtreme TDD: write a test, execute, debug, and code in the debugger (see following lecture)
- Tests are your best investment
