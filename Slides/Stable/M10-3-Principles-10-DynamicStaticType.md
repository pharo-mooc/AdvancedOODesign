```- The static type of variable `a` is `A`.- The dynamic type of a is `B`# Static typesPay attention to method signatures also define static types```	foo (A a){		}			foo(new B());```the static type of a is A, dynamic type of a is B# How do static and dynamic types interact?```class A {	void m(A a) { println("A.m(A)"); }}class B extends A {	void m(B b) { println("B.m(B)"); }}``````B b = new B(); A a = b;```What are the results of the invocations?```a.m(a);a.m(b);b.m(a);b.m(b);```# How do static and dynamic types interact?```class A {	void m(A a) { println("A.m(A)"); }}class B extends A {	void m(B b) { println("B.m(B)"); }}``````B b = new B(); A a = b;```What are the results of the invocations?```a.m(a);	A.m(A)a.m(b);	A.m(A)b.m(a);	A.m(A)b.m(b);	B.m(B)```- Static types determine which message is sent.- Dynamic types determine which method is called.# Compilation vs. executionAt compilation:- First, the **static** type of the receiver determines which class we consider- Second, does the class **define** the method?- Third, does the static type of the arguments **fit** the static type of the parameter?- Fourth, find the best fitAt execution: - the lookup starts in the class of the receiver# a.m(a)```class A {void m(A a) { println("A.m(A)"); }}class B extends A {void m(B b) { println("B.m(B)"); }}B b = new B(); A a = b;```- Step 1: receiver static type is `A`: we look in `A`- Step 2: there is a method `m`- Step 3: static type of `a` matches `A a` we will look for `m(A a)`The dynamic type of `a` is `B`. - The lookup starts in class `B` but looks for `m(A a)`- `> A.m(A)`# b.m(a)```class A {void m(A a) { println("A.m(A)"); }}class B extends A {void m(B b) { println("B.m(B)"); }}B b = new B(); A a = b;```- Step 1: the static type of `b` is `B`, so we look in `B` and its superclass `A`- Step 2: There is a method `m` \(in fact two `m(A a)` and `m(B b)`\)- Step 3: the static type of a is A we will look for `m(A a)`The dynamic type of `b` is `B`.- The lookup starts in class `B` and looks for `m(A a)`- `> A.m(A)`# b.m(b)```class A {void m(A a) { println("A.m(A)"); }}class B extends A {void m(B b) { println("B.m(B)"); }}B b = new B(); A a = b;```- Step 1: `b` static type is `B`, so we look in `B` and its superclass `A`- Step 2: There is a method `m` \(in fact two `m(A a)` and `m(B b)`\)- Step 3: the static type of `b` is `B` we will look for `m(B b)`- The lookup starts in class B and looks for “m\(B b\)”- `> B.m(B)`# a.m(b)```class A {void m(A a) { println("A.m(A)"); }}class B extends A {void m(B b) { println("B.m(B)"); }}B b = new B(); A a = b;```- Step 1: receiver static type is `A`: we only look in `A`- Step 2: there is a method `m`- Step 3: the static type of `b` is `B` but since `A` is a supertype of `B` this is ok we will look for `“m(A a)”`The dynamic type of `a` is `B`- The lookup starts in class B and looks for`m(A a)`- `> A.m(A)`# a.m(c)```class A {void m(A a) { println("A.m(A)"); }}class B extends A {void m(B b) { println("B.m(B)"); }}B b = new B(); A a = b; C c = new C;```- Step 1: We look only in `A`- Step 2: there is a method `m`- Step 3: C the static type of `c` does not match `A` there is no subtype relationsDoes not compile!# Conclusion- Examples used so far were simple- Be careful with static types, it can get tricky- More details on the lectures on overloading if needed- More details on the lectures on interfaces if needed
