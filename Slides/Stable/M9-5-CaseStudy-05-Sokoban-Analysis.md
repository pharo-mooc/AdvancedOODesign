are representing cases  - are the basis for dispatch- Not enough classes leads to **tricky conditionals** and **monolithic** systems- Remember the lectures **Implementing not, or...**![.](figures/Design-FatVsDispatch.pdf width=50)# Let us check the class APIClasses define:- `isEmptyBlock`- `isWall`- `hasPlayer`- `hasTarget`- `hasBox`Let us check the way this API is used# Too many ifs....```GameView >> drawBlock: aBlock on: aCanvas	aBlock isWall 		ifTrue: [ self drawWall: aCanvas ]		ifFalse: [ aBlock isEmptyBlock 			ifTrue: [ aBlock hasPlayer 					ifTrue: [ aBlock hasTarget 							ifTrue: [ self drawTargetAndPlayer: aCanvas ]						 	ifFalse: [ self drawPlayer: aCanvas ]]					ifFalse: [ aBlock hasBox 						ifTrue: [ aBlock hasTarget 							ifTrue: [ self drawTargetAndBox: aCanvas ]							ifFalse: [ self drawBox: aCanvas ]]					ifFalse: [ 						aBlock hasTarget 							ifTrue: [ self drawTarget: aCanvas ]						ifFalse: [ self drawEmptyBlock: aCanvas ]]]```# AnalysisThe model only defines `EmptyBlock` and `Wall`- No `Player`, no `Target`, no `Box`.- **Too much logic** is put in `EmptyBlock`- Too many questions, **not enough Tell** \(**Do not Ask, Tell**\)# With a better model- `Tile`  - `Box`  - `BoxOnTarget`  - `EmptyBlock`  - `Player`  - `Wall`- We can send **messages** to the 'correct' object- We can tell and not ask!# A first nicer solution```GameView >> drawBlock: aBlock on: aCanvas	aBlock isWall ifTrue: [ self drawWall: aCanvas ].	aBlock isEmptyBlock ifTrue: [ 	aBlock hasPlayer ifTrue: [ ...```Becomes```GameView >> drawBlock: aBlock on: aCanvas	aBlock drawOn: aCanvas Wall >> drawOn: aCanvas	"Cairo code"EmptyBlock >> drawOn: aCanvas	"Cairo code"```# A solution supporting multiple canvasesTo supporting multiple rendering back-ends \(morphic, Cairo...\),drawing should not be in the Block classes# A solution supporting multiple canvases```GameView >> drawBlock: aBlock on: aCanvas	aBlock isWall ifTrue: [ self drawWall: aCanvas ].	aBlock isEmptyBlock ifTrue: [ 	aBlock hasPlayer ifTrue: [ ...```Becomes```GameView >> drawBlock: aBlock on: aCanvas	aBlock drawOn: aCanvas for: aViewWall >> drawOn: aCanvas for: aView	aView drawWall: aCanvasEmptyBlock >> drawOn: aCanvas for: aView	aView drawEmptyBlock: aCanvas```# Double dispatchEach block tells the view how to draw it. ```GameView >> drawBlock: aBlock on: aCanvas	aBlock drawOn: aCanvas view: selfWall >> drawOn: aCanvas view: aView	aView drawWall: aCanvasEmptyBlock >> drawOn: aCanvas view: aView	aView drawEmptyBlock: aCanvas```- It is double dispatch with more objects- Sending messages is powerful- Modular# Intermezzo: Testing methods```Wall >> isWall	^ true	EmptyBlock >> isWall	^ false```- What do you think about it?# Disguided kind testing method```Wall >> isWall	^ true	EmptyBlock >> isWall	^ false```and ```GameView >> drawBlock: aBlock on: aCanvas	aBlock isWall ifTrue: [ self drawWall: aCanvas ]```is nearly the same as```GameView >> drawBlock: aBlock on: aCanvas	(aBlock isKindOf: Wall) ifTrue: [ self drawWall: aCanvas ].```# Back to the modelWhat are:- `MoveResult`  -
