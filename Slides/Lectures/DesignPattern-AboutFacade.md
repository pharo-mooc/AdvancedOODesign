{"title" : "About Facade","subtitle" : "","slidesid" : "From the Design Corner"}# Outline- Facade- Avoid it - Visitor variations# Facade intentA facade is an object that provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code, such as a class library.# "Expected" consequences A facade can:- make a software library easier to use, understand and test, since the facade has convenient methods for common tasks;- make the library more readable, for the same reason;- reduce dependencies of outside code on the inner workings of a library, since most code uses the facade, thus allowing more flexibility in developing the system;- wrap a poorly designed collection of APIs with a single well-designed API.# Seen consequencesOften people do not use Facade well- Procedural design  - all the clients refers to a single point: often a singleton- Hampering modularity  - Difficult to layer application   - Difficulty to unload the Facade# Studying Preferences Facade![.](figures/DP-AboutFacade-Plague.pdf width=45)- Control flow is not local- 180 system wide preferences - Impossible to remove Preferences packages- Preferences link to too many package \(default PngReader\)# Solution for preferences![.](figures/DP-AboutFacade-modularflow.pdf width=65)- Each element defines its preferences- The flow is local to the element- The local preferences are described- Layered architecture: we can remove Preferences # Conclusion- Facade may work - Usually this is a plague
