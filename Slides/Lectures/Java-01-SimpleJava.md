Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry- "I invented the term 'Object-Oriented', and I can tell you I did not have C++ in mind." Alan Kay \(nor Java :\)\)# Simple Java is an oxymoron- Java is gigantic and even more... \(looks more and more like an old verbose language\)- Full of conceptual glitches \(public fields, strange protected semantics, overloading...\)This lecture will not cover: packaging,  enums, lambdas, generics, inner classes, modules, private methods, visibility, synchronised, meta data, overloading, primitives vs. boxed....- But we will provide extras slides on more advanced topics# JavaNot pure object-oriented programming language- Static methods are not looked up- Primitive types are not objects: int and Integer....- Classes are not first class: cannot send messages to classes- Mixing physical representation \(files\) with concepts   - there is not need to have files to have classes  - class definitions can be saved in databases# Outline- Instances, instance creation- Classes / instance variables- Methods- Inheritance \(single\)- Method lookup- this / super- Constructor- Dynamic type vs. static types - Interface- Cast# Instances- Remember: one state, identity, behavior- Created using `new` construct```new Tomagotchi()```Often ```Tomagotchi t = new Tomagotchi()```# Class- Mold/Generators of instances```public class Rectangle {	protected int length;	protected int width;	...``````public class Box extends Rectangle {	    protected int height;}```# Class- Class import packages \(group of classes\) O\_o- One public class per file \(well\)- File name should have the name of the public class# Instance variables- Describe instance structure- Have a visibility: Avoid `public`, `private` and `final` :\)- Better use `protected` \(see companion extra lectures\)```public class Rectangle {	protected int length;	protected int width;	...```- Accessible by method of the class and subclasses# Methods- `this` represents the receiver- The lookup of methods at runtime starts in the class of the receiver.```public class Rectangle{		protected int length;	protected int width;		public int getArea() {		return length * width;	}```# Constructor (I)- A Constructor is a static function, it is not a method!- Responsible to properly initialize an object - `<class>()` is a default constructor```	public Rectangle() {		length = 0;		width = 0;	}```Multiple constructors in a class```	public Rectangle(int length, int width) {		this.length = length;		this.width = width;	}```# What you should know- Class/Instances- Methods- Constructors = functions
