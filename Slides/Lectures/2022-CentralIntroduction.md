# About (I)  
 
``` 
J'ai trouvé ça très intéressant, beaucoup plus que prévu ! 
je regrette de ne pas m'y être mis plus tôt. J'ai enfin l'impression 
de vraiment faire de la POO ! Ou à l'inverse je me rend que je n'en faisais 
pas vraiment... - Anonymous, 2019

# About (II)  
 
``` 
I have already learned so much ! I have spent the last 20 years or so in software development 
and, following this Mooc, I realized I hadn’t really grasped the essence of object oriented design. Anonymous'

I just completed the @pharoproject Mooc the best investment I have ever made of my time. MAQBOOL"

# A word of Presentation 
[http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr](http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr) 
- Core developer of Pharo - Head of the consortium 
- Language design \(traits in PHP, Scala, Perl, Groovy...\), maintenance, tests,... 
- Expert in OO Design, OO implementation and more 
Oleks 
- IA expert 
- Expert in OOP/OOD/TDD 
 
# Objectives 
- Become comfortable with object-oriented programming: Learn to think with objects 
- Tests 
- Essence of OOP:  
  - what really means to send a message 
  - what is this/super 
 
# About this lectures 
- Not a lecture on how to program  
- A lecture on how to DESIGN programs 
- It is not enough just to write code that works 
- _Design starts when the program compiles_ 
 
# Give some solid foundation for ANY OOP language 
The world is complex, there are many languages 
- Give you a key survival guide 
- Concepts available in any languages 
 
# What is design? 
- You learned so far how to code: writing functions, algorithms, structure ideas 
- Making extensible, maintainable, readbable code 
  - Tests 
  - Design nice and beautiful objects 
 
# Our teaching challenges 
- Some of you already 'know' \(got exposed to\) Java  
- Some never really programmed in OOP 
- Java is complex and ugly \(it polluted the essence of objects\) 
 
# Solution: Exposing yourself to beauty 
We do not grow 'Chefs' by feeding them with McDonald  
- Play the game 
-  
- Provide core and more advanced lectures \(free access/consumption\) 
 
# Solution: A la carte 
- Use the Pharo Mooc: [http://mooc.pharo.org](http://mooc.pharo.org) and do the exercises there 
- Don't be a Harry Potter, better an Hermione 
- But this is your life. 
 
# Pharo / Mooc 
https://www.fun-mooc.fr/fr/cours/programmation-objet-immersive-en-pharo/ 
- Watch [http://rmod-pharo-mooc.lille.inria.fr/MOOC/PharoMOOC-Videos/C0a19SD-Teaser-v4.mp4](http://rmod-pharo-mooc.lille.inria.fr/MOOC/PharoMOOC-Videos/C0a19SD-Teaser-v4.mp4) 
- Syntax fit on a postcard 
- Fully immersive  
- Will change totally the way to think about objects 
- learn XtremeTDD 
 
# Outline 
- Tests 
- Rethinking message passing 
- Rethinking `this`/ `super` / Inheritance  
- Hooks and template 
- Sending messages are plans for reuse 
- Avoid is null 
- Inheritance vs. Composition 
 
# At the end of the lecture 
You should be able to  
- Write tests and understand why but you need to practice 
- Write small programs in TDD with Pharo 
- Understand late binding for real 
- Get first level about what good design is about
